# My Personal Project - Ben Lu

## Project Name: Parsec

### Purpose
**What will Parsec do?** Parsec will be an interactive focus tool for those who wish to give their 
mundane work sessions a splash of colour. The central theme is space exploration, as the user sets timers to work or 
study, virtual astronauts can be sent to various colonies in our solar system. This creates a sense of progression 
over time and makes the user's everyday life just a little more interesting.

**Time required for each colony:**
- it will take 15 minutes to reach the Moon
- it will take 30 minutes to reach Mars
- it will take 45 minutes to reach Jupiter
- it will take 60 minutes to reach Saturn


**Progression System**

Every minute the user focuses for adds an astronaut to the trip. For example, a 30-minute trip to the Moon adds a 
total of 30 astronauts to the Moon colony. Note that if one does not reach the required number of minutes to reach 
a certain destination, they can instead choose a closer location to travel to, such as  a 75-minute trip to Jupiter 
bringing 75 astronauts to the Jupiter colony as Saturn cannot be reached within 75 minutes. As the number of 
astronauts on each colony grows, they level up. Each level requires an additional 100 astronauts, starting at level 
0 with 0 astronauts. 

### Target Demographic

**Who will use Parsec?** Parsec will be a user-friendly, minimalistic application. As such, people of 
any age who are relatively experienced with basic computer operations should be able to access it easily. In terms of 
who would want to use it, I believe good candidates will mainly be students and adults who strive for better 
productivity, or even just someone who is a fan of space and wants another reason to focus better during their work 
hours.

**Why is this project of interest to you?** I have always been a big fan of space and have just recently started 
using various focus tools to help me stay on track during university life. I am interested in this project because 
it has a relatively simple function yet does not mean it is rudimentary, and that I can actually see myself wanting 
to use it if I had discovered it online. I also think that given the elements involves space and the different planets,
it would make for an aesthetically pleasing graphical interface if done correctly.


###USER STORIES
**PHASE 1**

- As a user, I want to be able to set a count-down timer / create a new trip 
- As a user, I want to be able to choose the destination of each trip
- As a user, I want to be able to add my trips to my trip logs
- As a user, I want to be able to see my trip logs and edit them
- As a user, I want to be able to see the levels of my colonies

**PHASE 2**
- As a user, I want to be able to save my trips as well as the levels of my colonies resulting from those trips
- As a user, I want to be able to have the option of loading my saved trips from file
- As a user, I want to be prompted to save my trips when I attempt to exit the program with unsaved edits


###Phase 4
**Task 2**

Below is a sample of the events that may occur when Parsec runs:

-----------
_New trip to Moon added.  
New trip to Mars added.  
New trip to Jupiter added.  
New trip to Saturn added.  
New trip to Saturn added.  
Trip at position 5 has been deleted.  
Trip log cleared.  
Trips saved._
