# My Personal Project

## Project Name: Light-seconds

### Purpose
**What will Light-seconds do?** Light-seconds will be an interactive focus tool for those who wish to give their 
mundane work sessions a splash of colour. The central theme is space exploration, as the user sets timers to work or 
study, virtual astronauts can be sent to various colonies in our solar system. This creates a sense of progression 
over time and makes the user's everyday life just a little more interesting.

Time required to go to each location:
- 15 minutes equates to a trip to the Moon
- 30 minutes equates to a trip to Mars
- 60 minutes equates to a trip to Jupiter (Underwater colony on Europa)
- 90 minutes equates to a trip to Saturn (Colony on Titan)


Progression System

Each single trip carries 10 astronauts to each colony, and the colonies level up as their number of colonizers 
increase over time. Each level requires an additional 100 astronauts, starting at level 0 with 0 astronauts. A user 
can also choose to send 40 astronauts to Moon for a 60 minute trip or 20 astronauts to Mars or 10 to Jupiter. 

### Target Demographic

**Who will use Light-seconds?** Light-seconds will be a user-friendly, minimalistic application. As such, people of 
any age who are relatively experienced with basic computer operations should be able to access it easily. In terms of 
who would want to use it, I believe good candidates will mainly be students and adults who strive for better 
productivity, or even just someone who is a fan of space and wants another reason to focus better during their work 
hours.

**Why is this project of interest to you?** I have always been a big fan of space and have just recently started 
using various focus tools to help me stay on track during university life. I am interested in this project because 
it has a relatively simple function yet does not mean it is rudimentary, and that I can actually see myself wanting 
to use it if I had discovered it online. I also think that given the elements involves space and the different planets,
it would make for an aesthetically pleasing graphical interface if done correctly.


###USER STORIES
- As a user, I want to be able to add time to the timer in 15 minute increments
- As a user, I want to be able to choose the destination and amount of astronauts in each trip
- As a user, I want to be able to see the trips that I have completed
- As a user, I want to be able to see the levels of my colonies
